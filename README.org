  If you are like me and hate rounded tabs, this is for you.

  Overall I understand why Mozilla went the direction they did with [[https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Proton][Proton]] to "modernize" the UI, but not to say that I have to like it.
  
  These tweaks attempt to recreate the feel of Quantum with its squared tabs and menus, but in the Proton UI.

** Introduction
  [[https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Proton][Proton]] is Firefox's new design, starting from Firefox 89. \\
  [[https://design.firefox.com/photon/][Photon]] is the old design of Firefox which was used until version 88.

  Proton's [[#why-proton][overall feel is good]], but there were a few things I [[#why-not-proton][didn't like]] and wanted to improve. \\
  That's why this project was born, and Lepton to denote light theme layer.

  /Disclaimer:/ It works *Firefox 89* and above!!
